stringcase is a lightweight Go library that implements a few simple
utilities for transforming strings. It has no dependencies outside of
the Go standard library.

## Usage

* `snake_case` and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

    ```go
    stringcase.ToSnake("NotSnake") // -> "not_snake"
    stringcase.ToUpperSnake("NotSnake") // -> "NOT_SNAKE"
    ````

* `camelCase` and `UpperCamelCase` (aka `PascalCase`)

    ```go
    stringcase.ToCamel("not-Camel") // -> "notCamel"
    stringcase.ToUpperCamel("not-Camel") // -> "NotCamel"
    ```

* `kebab` and `UPPER-KEBAB`

    ```go
    stringcase.ToKebab("NotKebab") // -> "not-kebab"
    stringcase.ToUpperKebab("NotKebab") // -> "NOT-KEBAB"
    ```

If you are curious about the rules for converting strings, take a look at
[the test file](./stringcase_test.go) for examples.

## Install

This package uses go modules and you should be able to use the latest release tag.

```shell
go get -u github.com/mrosales/stringcase
```

## Implementation Details

#### Special Characters

All converters will **remove any non-alphanumeric characters**. That means things like
emojis, punctuation, whitespace and other unicode characters will all be removed.

#### Word Breaks

Before transforming the string, it is first split into words. This
implementation tries to do the **right thing**â„¢, but it may very well
break some part of your use case. If you encounter something that seems
**incorrect**, don't hesitate to file an issue. That being said, it may
not be possible to update the library to cover every edge case.

The following cases trigger a word break:

* Any non alphanumeric character (`[^a-zA-Z0-9]`)
* Any whitespace (`\s+`)
* Transitioning from lowercase to uppercase
  This attempts to respect Go's preference to capitalize acronyms and abbreviations.
    * `fooBar` -> `foo Bar`
    * `fooBAR` -> `foo BAR`
    * `userID` -> `user ID`
    * `userIDFOO` -> `user IDFOO` (*nothing we can really do about a string like this*)
* Transitioning from uppercase to lowercase
    * `userIDBar` -> `user ID Bar`

## Inspiration

* [`github.com/iancoleman/strcase`](https://github.com/iancoleman/strcase)
    * This is a great library that I used for some time before this, but I felt
      like the camelcase implementation in particular seemed inconsistent.
      For example, I would prefer `ToCamel("fooBAR")` to return `"fooBar"` rather than
      `"fooBar"`. This is not necessarily wrong, but it does not match how
      `ToSnake("fooBAR")` for that library returns `foo_bar`.
    * The change that this `stringcase` library makes is to first split the string into
      words and then join them in canonical fashion for each type of casing. This is
      slightly less efficient, but I find it to produce more predictable results.
